Developed with Unreal Engine 5

This is an unreal project for demonstrating skills of the developer. Its purpose is to show game programming skill set and for an upcoming research paper of the developer.

IMPORTANT
* Due to the restrictions the game apk file is made by setting target android 9 (Pie) , which is done by setting target sdk 28. After enough hit and trials , the default deploying settings are used for developing , testing and pckagaing the apk file.
* The ingame vibration feature only works if the user of the android device have enabled the "Haptic Feedack" from their device settings.
* All the assets used in the game such as music , audio effects , icons etc are taken from the commercial game (music by Honkai Star Rail) , audio effects (from epic store , online free sites such as mixkit) , icons (pngwing , svgrepo , pngtree etc).
* This project is not going to be capitalized and Only going to be used for survey purposes and for skill demonstration purposes , i.e. why the developer have not taken the permission from the commercial game to use their music.
* Note that the apk file is cooked for an old android version 9 ((Pie) , so if the installation handler states any security risks during installation of the game , it is a false alarm occuring due to the android security policies. User can ignore this issue and continue with "Install Anyway".
* The game asks for the file read write permission during the executioning of the game because the way unreal engine handles "SaveGame" files in the android. External Storage read write permission is Only being used for storing the in game data of the user.
